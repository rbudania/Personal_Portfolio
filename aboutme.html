<center><h2 class="hd"><a name="b"></a>EARLY DAYS</h2>
        <p class="para">Early days!! seems nice</br>Honestly speaking early days were really fun,I have travelled a lot,explored many places but obvisiouly with parents!
         In my childhood days i  played many games and also managed to score good marks , I seriously want that life balancing skills back in me.
         </br>Old is gold, it is always said. When I was a five-year old, some 15 years ago, my elders said their olden days were gold. Today, i also believe, “old is gold.”

       I always wonder why everyone's olden days are better than their present. Old music and songs were good. Old films were outstanding. Old clothings were of better quality. Old craftsmanship was worthier. Old silk sarees were good. In the olden days, food was of high standards. Old vessels and wares were of high quality.

         Old teachers were excellent.
